i was asked to achieve the following:
in task1: Write a script that accepts a string from user through prompt and 
count the number of a specific character that the user will define in 
another prompt. Ask the user whether to consider difference between 
letter cases or not then display the number of letter appearance. 

in task2: Write a script to determine whether the entered string is 
palindrome or not.  Request the string to be entered via prompt, ask the 
user whether to consider case sensitivity of the entered string or not via 
confirm, handle both cases in your script 
i.e. RADAR NOON MOOM are palindrome. 
Note: raDaR is not a palindrome if user requested considering case of 
entered string, it will be palindrome if user requested ignoring case 
sensitivity. 

in task3: Build your own function that takes a single string argument and 
returns the largest word in the string. If there are two or more words 
that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that 
length.  
e.g. if Input is: "this is a javascript string demo" 
Output will be: javascript 


in task4: Write a script that reads from the user his info; validates and 
displays it with a welcoming message with today’s date
Name:should be character, not a number
Phone_Number:should be number, with length=8
Mobile_Number:should be numbers, with length=11 and starts with (011|010|012) use REGEXP
Email: should use regular exp to validate that the email is formatted correctly (abc@123.com)
Use coloring format according to user’s choice. The user has to choose 
either red, green or blue color, take his choice via prompt.
